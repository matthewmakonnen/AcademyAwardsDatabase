# Academy Awards Database (INST 327 - Group Project)

### Introduction
- This project is part of an exercise for the "Database Design and Modeling" course (INST 327).
- The project's main goal is to build a database that tracks Academy Award 'Best Picture' winners from 1989 to 2021 and allows users to extract insights and information regarding the selected winners.

### Database Description
- In the 'Academy Awards (1989 - 2021)' database, there are seven tables that build the foundation of the database. The main table titled "movie_oscars" holds general information and important dates regarding films that have won the "Academy Award for Best Picture". Tables titled "director", "cameraman", and "writer" contain first and last name information of the person working at that position for the specific "Best Picture" film. The "genre" table has information regarding the genre of the "Best Picture" film, while the "film_production" table contains information on film production companies associated with different "Best Picture" films. Also, the "rating" table holds information on the IMDb ratings and Rotten Tomatoes scores of the "Best Picture" films.
